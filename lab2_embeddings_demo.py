Why do we need so many dimensions? Each dimension captures different aspects:
• Tone (formal vs casual)
• Context (work vs personal)
• Formality level
• Semantic category
• And hundreds more subtle features!

Think of it like describing a person:
• 1D: Just height (not enough!)
• 2D: Height + weight (better)
• 384D: Everything from personality to preferences (complete picture!)

Industry standard: 768-1536 dimensions for production systems.
Our model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2): 384 dimensions - perfect balance!

What you discovered:
1. Real AI models convert text to 384-dimensional vectors
2. Similar meanings → Similar vectors (even with different words!)
3. "dress code" and "clothing rules" have high similarity despite ZERO shared words
4. AI accurately scores relevance: dress code queries rank high, weather ranks low

This is the foundation of semantic search!
Next, we'll implement similarity search to find relevant documents.
